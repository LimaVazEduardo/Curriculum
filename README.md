## About
```
I've been learning about software development projects every since I finished college.  
I have seen many technologies coming and going. 
Many programming languages glowing and fading away.  
Many management approaches fighting to be number one.  

What I have learned so far?  
I’ve learned that people create successful projects, not tools.  
Successful projects are defined by the customer.  
People should be the priority and also, Continuous Improvement is the only way to go.
